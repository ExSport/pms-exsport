= Some tips how to use new features =

=== PMS.conf file ===
You can define *`forced_subs_tags`* in PMS.conf to specify tags which are used for *`forced`* subtitles.<br><br>
*Example:*
{{{
# detect forced subtitle track (detection done by keywords in subtitle tag/description)
# partial search works so defining "sing" will find also "singing"
# when external subtitle file used, use "-" as delimiter. Example: moviename.en-forced.srt
forced_subs_tags=forced,singing,titles
}}}
If this keyword is omitted, *`forced`* tag is used as default.

=== Renderer.conf ===
You can define renderer specific keywords which works on renderer level<br><br>
*Examples:*
{{{
# You can define specific filters working on renderer level
# It means you can now easily define deinterlacer for Samsung TV and upscaler for PS3 etc.
# Please use escaping by using "\" character when special char used
# When this keyword is not defined, global settings in PMS has precedence
# Example below adds black bars to fix aspect ratio problems on most TV like Panasonic, Samsung, Sony etc.
CustomMencoderOptions=-vf softskip,expand=::::1:16\/9:4

# You can set different quality settings for every renderer separately.
# It works better like bandwidth limiting because it is not so CPU aggresive
CustomMencoderQualitySettings=keyint=5:vqscale=1:vqmin=3:vqmax=5

# Show audio and subtitle tag for every track in #TRANSCODE# folder, if defined
# It is useful to diferentiate between documentary audio or subtitle track, full or forced subtitles etc.
# When not defined, TRUE is used as default (Metadata tags are retrieved by MediaInfo/FFmpeg engine)
ShowAudioMetadata=false
ShowSubMetadata=true

# When true, PMS pass DLNA compliancy when MediaInfo=true
# Default behavior of PMS is not DLNA compliant so almost all rendereres doesn't work correctly without this fix
# PMS counts all files in folder before sent to renderer so total count is known to renderer = more compatible
AnalyzeAllBeforeFolderShown=true
}}}

== How to configure forced subtitles: ==
_To define tag for external subtitle file use this example:_<br>
*_moviename.cs-full.srt_* or *_moviename.cs-forced.srt_* etc. Delimiter for tag is "*-*"<br>
For tagging subtitles in MKV container(if tag is missing), you can use e.g. *_MKVTOOLNIX_* and add this info as "*Track name*".<br><br>
*How to set preferred language for `Forced` subtitles in PMS:*<br>
*`Subtitles language priority:`* - here put required subtitle code (only one supported!)<br><br>

*When correctly configured, how to load subs automatically?*
  * you need to enable "*`Autoload *.srt/*.sub subtitles with the same name`*" in PMS
  * and choose *`[MENCODER]`* or *`[MENCODER]{External Subtitles}`* inside *`#--TRANSCODE--#`* folder
  * or choose *`Movie_Name.avi[MENCODER]{External Subtitles}`* outside *`#--TRANSCODE--#`* folder
  * when *`TSmuxer`* engine is used, you need browse to *`#--TRANSCODE--#`* folder to fire up *`MEncoder`* engine
