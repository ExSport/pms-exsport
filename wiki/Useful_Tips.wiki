= Some tips how to use new features =

=== PMS.conf file ===
You can define *`forced_subs_tags`* in PMS.conf to specify tags which are used for *`forced`* subtitles.<br><br>
*Example:*
{{{
# detect forced subtitle track (detection done by keywords in subtitle tag/description)
# partial search works so defining "sing" will find also "singing"
forced_subs_tags=forced,singing,titles
}}}
If this keyword is omitted, *`forced`* tag is used as default.

=== Renderer.conf ===
You can define renderer specific keywords which works on renderer level<br><br>
*Examples:*
{{{
# You can define specific filters working on renderer level
# It means you can now easily define deinterlacer for Samsung TV and upscaler for PS3 etc.
# Please use escaping by using "\" character when special java char used
# When this keyword is not defined, global settings in PMS has precedence
# Example below adds black bars to fix aspect ratio problems on most TV like Panasonic, Samsung, Sony etc.
CustomMencoderOptions=-vf softskip,expand=::::1:16\/9:4

# You can set different quality settings for every renderer separately.
# It works better like bandwidth limiting because it is not so CPU aggresive
CustomMencoderQualitySettings=keyint=5:vqscale=1:vqmin=3:vqmax=5

# Show audio and subtitle tag for every track in #TRANSCODE# folder, if defined
# It is useful to diferentiate between documentary audio or subtitle track, full or forced subtitles etc.
# When not defined, TRUE is used as default (Metadata tags are detected by MediaInfo/FFmpeg engine)
ShowAudioMetadata=false
ShowSubMetadata=true

# When true, PMS pass DLNA compliancy when MediaInfo=true
# Default behavior of PMS is not DLNA compliant so almost all rendereres doesn't work correctly without this fix
# PMS counts all files in folder before sent to renderer so total count is known to renderer = more compatible
AnalyzeAllBeforeFolderShown=true
